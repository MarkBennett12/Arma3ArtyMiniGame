# Arma3ArtyMiniGame
An artillery mini-game for Arma 3

The idea is that each time artillery fires a circle centered around the artilleries position will be drawn on the opposing teams map. The size of this circle will get progressively smaller as the artillery fires until it relocates to a new position beyond a spoecified distance away. At this point the circle will be reset to it's initial size (probably the artilleries maximum range or something similar.
